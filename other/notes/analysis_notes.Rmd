segments 5 km corresponding to finest resolution of covariate data (as in Becker et al 2010 & PRISMM)

"Count model" only lets us use segment-level covariates
- response is counts per segment
- adjusting for effort
- area = Aj * pj (area of each segment is area multiplied by detection probability given the conditions)

"Estimated abundance" lets us use either seg-level or observation-level
- horvitz thompson estimator is response  
- effort is area of each segment

When to use each approach?
Generally "nicer" to adjust effort
Keep response (counts) close to what was observed
Unless you want observation-level covariates

Therefore, check relevant covariates for each species.
